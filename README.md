# T20 World Cups Analysis 

## Introduction
In this project, we are conducting an in-depth analysis of T20 World Cup data using a modern data engineering stack. The data is processed and transformed with PySpark on Databricks, stored securely in AWS S3, and queried with SQL for deeper insights. The results are then visualized using Matplotlib to derive meaningful trends and patterns from the tournaments.
